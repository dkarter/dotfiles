# workmux

workmux manages git worktrees paired with tmux windows for parallel
development. Each worktree is an isolated workspace with its own branch,
terminal state, and AI agent.

**If the user asks you to create worktrees or dispatch tasks (e.g.,
"/workmux add ..."), you are a dispatcher.** Write prompt files and run
commands. Do NOT explore, read, or research the codebase first. Use
context you already have. The worktree agent does all the work.

## Key Concepts

- **Handle**: the worktree directory name, derived from the branch name
  (slugified). Used to identify worktrees in all commands
- **Worktree directory**: defaults to `<project>__worktrees/<handle>` as a
  sibling of the project root
- **Window prefix**: tmux windows are named `wm-<handle>` by default
  (configurable via `window_prefix`)
- **Agent status**: agents report status via hooks: working, waiting (needs
  input), done (finished)

## Commands

### Create a worktree

```bash
workmux add <branch-name>
```

Creates a git worktree, runs file operations and hooks, creates a tmux
window with configured pane layout, and switches to it.

Key flags:

- `-b, --background`: create without switching to it
- `-p <text>`: inline prompt for AI agent panes
- `-P <file>`: prompt from file
- `-e, --prompt-editor`: write prompt in $EDITOR
- `-A, --auto-name`: generate branch name from prompt via LLM
- `-a <agent>`: override the agent (can specify multiple for multi-worktree)
- `-w, --with-changes`: move uncommitted changes to the new worktree
- `--base <branch>`: branch from a specific base
- `--name <name>`: override the handle name
- `-o, --open-if-exists`: open existing worktree if it exists (idempotent)
- `-W, --wait`: block until the tmux window is closed
- `-n, --count <N>`: create N worktree instances
- `--foreach <matrix>`: create worktrees from variable matrix
- `--no-hooks, --no-file-ops, --no-pane-cmds`: skip setup steps

### List worktrees

```bash
workmux list          # all worktrees
workmux list --pr     # with GitHub PR status
workmux list <name>   # filter by handle or branch
```

Shows branch, agent status, tmux window status, and unmerged commits.

### Merge a branch

```bash
workmux merge                 # merge current branch into main
workmux merge <branch>        # merge specific branch
workmux merge --rebase        # rebase before merging (linear history)
workmux merge --squash        # squash all commits into one
workmux merge --into <branch> # merge into a different target branch
workmux merge --keep          # merge but keep worktree/window/branch
workmux merge --notification  # show system notification on success
```

Merges the branch, deletes the tmux window, removes the worktree, and
deletes the local branch. Use the `/merge` skill for the full workflow
(commit, rebase, then merge).

### Remove worktrees

```bash
workmux remove                # current worktree
workmux remove <name>...      # specific worktrees
workmux rm --gone             # worktrees whose remote branch was deleted
workmux rm --all              # all worktrees
workmux rm -f <name>          # force, skip confirmation
workmux rm --keep-branch      # keep the branch, remove worktree + window
```

### Open / close windows

```bash
workmux open <name>           # open or switch to tmux window
workmux open --new            # force a new window (creates suffix -2, -3)
workmux open <name> -p "..."  # open with a prompt for agent panes
workmux close <name>          # close tmux window, keep worktree
```

### Interact with other agents

These commands target agents by their worktree handle. If the handle is
not found in the current repo, workmux searches all active agents globally.
Use `project:handle` syntax to disambiguate when names collide.

```bash
# Check agent statuses
workmux status                          # all agents
workmux status auth api-tests           # specific agents

# Wait for agents
workmux wait agent-a agent-b            # block until done
workmux wait agent-a --timeout 3600     # with timeout (seconds)
workmux wait agent-a agent-b --any      # wait for first to finish
workmux wait agent-a --status working   # wait for specific status

# Read agent terminal output
workmux capture agent-a                 # last 200 lines (default)
workmux capture agent-a -n 50           # last 50 lines

# Send instructions to an agent
workmux send agent-a "fix the tests"    # short message
workmux send agent-a "/merge"           # send a skill command
workmux send agent-a -f followup.md     # from file
workmux send myproject:docs "update the API section"  # cross-project

# Run shell commands in an agent's worktree
workmux run agent-a -- pytest tests/    # wait and stream output
workmux run agent-a -b -- npm run build # run in background
```

### Other commands

```bash
workmux path <name>           # print worktree filesystem path
workmux dashboard             # TUI dashboard of all active agents
workmux config edit           # open global config in $EDITOR
workmux config reference      # print default config with all options documented
workmux init                  # generate .workmux.yaml in current project
```

## Configuration

Two levels: global (`~/.config/workmux/config.yaml`) and project
(`.workmux.yaml`). Project overrides global.

### Key options

```yaml
agent: claude # default agent for <agent> placeholder
merge_strategy: rebase # merge, rebase, or squash
mode: window # window or session

panes:
  - command: <agent> # <agent> resolves to configured agent
    focus: true
  - split: horizontal # second pane with shell

files:
  copy:
    - .env # copy from main worktree
  symlink:
    - node_modules # symlink from main worktree

post_create:
  - '<global>' # include global hooks
  - npm install # project-specific setup

base_branch: develop # default base for new worktrees
window_prefix: wm- # tmux window name prefix
```

Use `'<global>'` in project config arrays to include global values.

For the full configuration reference with all options documented, run
`workmux config reference`.

### Agent detection

Built-in agents (`claude`, `gemini`, `codex`, `opencode`, `kiro-cli`,
`vibe`) are auto-detected in pane commands and receive prompt injection
automatically. The `<agent>` placeholder resolves to the configured agent.

## Common Workflows

### Finishing work: direct merge

Use `/merge` to commit, rebase onto the base branch, and merge in one
step. This cleans up the worktree, tmux window, and branch.

### Finishing work: PR-based

1. Commit changes
2. `git push -u origin HEAD`
3. Use `/open-pr` to write a PR description and open in browser
4. After PR is merged remotely, clean up with `workmux rm --gone`

### Delegating tasks

Use `/worktree` to spin off tasks into parallel worktree agents. The
agent writes a prompt file and runs `workmux add -b -P <file>`.

For full lifecycle orchestration (spawn, monitor, merge), use
`/coordinator`.

### Cross-project worktree creation

`workmux add` creates worktrees in the current git repo and adds the
window to the current tmux session. To create a worktree in a different
project, run `workmux add` inside that project's tmux session.

Discover project paths from existing sessions:

```bash
tmux list-sessions -F '#{session_name} #{session_path}'
```

Then create the worktree in the target session:

```bash
# If the session exists:
tmux new-window -t <session> -c <project-path> \
  "workmux add <branch> -b -P <prompt-file>; exit"

# If the session does not exist, create it first:
tmux new-session -d -s <session> -c <project-path> && \
tmux new-window -t <session> -c <project-path> \
  "workmux add <branch> -b -P <prompt-file>; exit"
```

The temporary window closes when `workmux add` finishes; the worktree
window that workmux creates stays in the session.

Do NOT research before dispatching. Use context you already have, but
do not explore or read code just to write the prompt. Worktree agents
can read files from other projects via absolute paths, so reference
other projects by path and let the agent explore on its own.
