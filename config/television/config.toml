# as hex values (e.g., "#ff0000", "#1e1e2e").
#
# Example overrides:
# [ui.theme_overrides]
# background = "#000000"
# text_fg = "#ffffff"
# selection_bg = "#444444"
# match_fg = "#ff0000"

#          `git checkout`  should trigger the `git-branches` channel
#          `ls`            should trigger the `dirs` channel
#          `cat` and `cp`  should trigger the `files` channel
