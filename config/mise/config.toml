# NOTE: cargo backends are slower because they compile from source. I usually
# prefer not to use those, but in some cases there is no ARM64 binary available
# via Aqua / Github - so we have to use cargo, in other cases, there are no
# pre-compiled binaries at all - in such cases we should check periodically if
# binaries were published or contribute a fix to pre-compile binaries for arm64.
#
# Tools with no ARM bins:
# - vivid
# - du-dust

# For the same reason - sometimes github backend is selected when aqua is
# available, if the aqua backend gets the architecture wrong:
# - hyperfine
